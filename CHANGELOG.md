### Added

- `Client` instances can now be used in a `with` statement to manage the lifecycle
  of the underlying threads.

## [2.11.0] - 2021-07-15

### Added

- Introduced `pulp_repository_published` hook. This may be used to subscribe to all
  repository publish events triggered by this library.

### Changed

- Internal refactoring for improved debuggability.

## [2.10.0] - 2021-06-28

### Added
- Filename attribute for RpmUnit class
- nsvca property for ModulemdUnit class

## [2.9.0] - 2021-06-15
### Added
- Support for various repo notes for Repository model
- Support for various fields of ModuleMd unit
- Introduced YumRepository.get_x_repository methods that can retrieve
  related binary, debug and source repository

## [2.8.0] - 2021-03-17

### Added
- Maximum number of queued or running Pulp tasks can be customized by callers

## [2.7.0] - 2020-06-11

### Fixed

## [2.6.0] - 2020-05-05

### Added
- sourcerpm attribute for Rpm unit
- client.search_content method
- Introduced 'population_sources' and 'ubi_population' attributes for yum repository

### Fixed
- 'stream' and 'profiles' are now optional on modulemd_defaults units, rather
  than incorrectly mandatory (leading to schema validation errors)

## [2.5.0] - 2020-02-25

### Added
- Introduced `Repository.sync` API (and associated `SyncOptions` classes)
  for synchronizing Pulp repositories.

## [2.4.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added
- Introduced `Repository.search_content` API for retrieving content units
  from Pulp repositories.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that export an empty maintenance report would crash.
- Fixed another bug that maintenance report could have an invalid `last_updated_by` value.

## [2.3.1] - 2019-10-03

### Fixed
- Fixed certain exceptions from requests library not being propagated properly while
  getting maintenance report.

### Changed
- Task failure/completion logs now include task tags.
- Patterns to `Matcher.regex` are now more strictly typechecked when the matcher is created.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-09-25

### Added
- Introduced `Distributor.delete` for deleting a distributor from Pulp.

## [2.2.0] - 2019-09-16

### Added
- Introduced "proxy futures" for values produced by this library.
- Added a new attribute `relative_url` to `Distributor`, so users can search distributors
  by relative_url

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-10

### Added
- A `search_distributor` API to search distributors on defined `Criteria`
- `Matcher.less_than()` matcher to find the results with fields less than
  the given value

### Fixed
- Fixed certain exceptions from requests library (such as SSL handshake errors) not being
  propagated correctly.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-09

### Added
- ``Page`` objects may now be directly used as iterables

### Changed
- **API break**: types of fields on model objects are now strictly validated
  during construction.
- **API break**: objects documented as immutable are now more deeply immutable;
  it is no longer possible to mutate list fields on these objects.
- **API break**: fixed inconsistencies on collection model fields. All fields
  previously declared as tuples have been updated to use (immutable) lists.

### Fixed
- **API break**: `MaintenanceReport.last_updated`, `MaintenanceEntry.started`
  are now `datetime` objects as documented. In previous versions, these were
  documented as datetimes but implemented as `str`.

### Deprecated
- ``Page.as_iter`` is now deprecated.

## [1.5.0] - 2019-09-03

### Added
- Introduced ``Repository.remove_content`` to remove contents of a repository.
- Introduced ``Unit`` classes representing various types of Pulp units.

### Fixed
- Fixed hashability of `PulpObject` subclasses, making it possible to use them
  in sets/dicts

### Deprecated
- ``Task.units_data`` is now deprecated in favor of ``Task.units``.

## [1.4.0] - 2019-09-02

### Added
- Support querying and updating maintenance mode of Pulp repositories
- Introduced ``Client.get_content_type_ids`` method to retrieve supported content types.

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash in `upload_file` when passed a file object opened in text mode

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-15

### Added

- Introduced ``Repository.is_temporary`` attribute
- Extended search functionality; it is now possible to search using fields defined
  on the `PulpObject` classes. Searching on raw Pulp fields remains supported.

### Fixed
- Fixed inconsistency between real and fake clients: both clients now immediately raise
  if a search is attempted with invalid criteria.  Previously, the fake client would
  instead return a failed `Future`.

## [1.2.1] - 2019-08-12

### Fixed
- Fixed import conflicts for `pubtools` module

## [1.2.0] - 2019-08-07

  using new `Matcher` class

  to the search result
